Setup to run robot tests on windows:

	1. Install java (from java.com)
	2. Launch java control panel (aka "Configure java")
	3. On security tab, add your machine (192.168.1.12 in my case) to the "Exception site list".

	In addition, respond to any browser prompts to allow the plugin to run.

To build the JAR file:

	$ sh compilerobot.sh

To sign the JAR file:

	Get the dojo.pfx file plus password from Dylan, and run:

	$ jarsigner -storetype pkcs12 -keystore ~/Downloads/dojo.pfx DOHRobot.jar "js foundation's comodo ca limited id"
