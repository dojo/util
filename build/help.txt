NAME
     The Dojo Builder - Read, process, and write a set of resources as instructed by a profile.

DESCRIPTION
     Discover and process a set of resources with an ordered synchronized set of transforms.

     See http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/build/index.html for reference documentation.
     
     See http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/build/qref.html for a quick reference manual.

     Typically this program is executed with the convience wrapper /util/buildscripts/build.bat (Window) or
     /util/buildscripts/build.sh (all other environments); it may also be executed explicitly.

     Usage with the build script on non-windows:
     path/to/util/buildscripts/build.sh [options]
     
     Usage with the build script on windows:
     IMPORTANT: the util/buildscripts directory must be the current working directory
     build.bat [options]

     Explicit usage with node.js:
     node path/to/dojo/dojo.js load=build [options] 
     
     Explicit usage with java:
     java -Xms256m -Xmx256m -jar path/to/util/shrinksafe/js.jar path/to/dojo/dojo.js baseUrl=path/to/dojo load=build [options]
     
     IMPORTANT:
     This program assumes the default directory structure provided with the standard dojo source release.
     
     IMPORTANT:
     When using v1.6- profiles, this program assumes the current working directory is utils/buildscripts.

OPTIONS
     -p <filename>
     --profile <filename>      read profile for file
     
     -p <profile>
     --profile <profile>       read profile from profile in util/buildscripts/profiles
     
     --package <path>          read profile from package.json located in the directory path
     
     --require <filename>
     --dojoConfig              read profile from loader configuration 
     
     --htmlFiles <file-list>   deduce profile from HTML file(s); file-list is a comma-separated list of filenames
     
     --htmlDir <path>          deduce profile from all HTML files in directory at path
     
     --check-args              print computed raw command line input, including raw profiles, then terminate
     
     --check                   print computed profile, then terminate
     
     --check-discovery         print all discovered resources, then terminate
     
     --debug-check             print computed profile, including internal structures
     
     -r
     --release                 process the build control script(s) and/or profile(s) and transform sources into a release
     
     --releaseDir <path>       base directory for build output
     
     --releaseName <string>    path segment to append to releaseDir that gives base directory for build output

     --layerOptimize <arg>     process all layer resources in order to minimize resource size; arg as follows:
                                   comments             => remove comments with ShrinkSafe
                                   comments.keeplines   => as above, but don't remove newlines
                                   shrinksafe           => minimize with ShrinkSafe
                                   shrinksafe.keeplines => as above, but don't remove newlines
                                   closure              => minimize with the Google Closure compiler
                                   closure.keeplines    => as above, but don't remove newlines
                                   uglify               => minimize with Uglify
                                   uglify.keeplines     => as above, but don't remove newlines
                               (note: all args are case-insensitive)

     --optimize <arg>          analogous to --layerOptimize, but applied to non-layer resources

     --useSourceMaps <arg>     create source maps when the Google Closure compiler is used; arg as follows:
                                   true  => create source maps (default)
                                   false => don't create source maps

     --copyTests <arg>         copy test files and the DOH package; arg as follows:
                                   false => don't copy tests
                                   true  => copy test resources, but don't apply any transforms
                                   build => copy and build tests resources just as if they were normal resources

     --mini                    Ignore resources tagged as not mini (e.g. tests, demos dijit/bench, etc.)
     
     -v                        print the program's version number
     
     --help                    this help message
     
     Scalar profile property values may also be specified as options with the syntax
     
          --<profile-property-name> <value>
